#Scraper & Django#

[Working version](http://reducenoise.herokuapp.com).

Project for my capstone technology class.

Completely functional, scraper writes to django app.

You can set up the scraper to run a cron job and go get the data once a day. You must configure the scraping script to your three websites. Both in the global one, two and three variables and in how the scraper functions. Since every site is different the headlines will be in different divs than in my example. NOTE: All Digital First sites are similar, that's why the Camera and Post scrapes look similar.

Lots of thanks to [this Django tutorial](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/get-started-django-7132932).
